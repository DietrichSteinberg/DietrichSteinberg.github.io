          <p>
            For my paddle design I chose to make a rectangular paddle with the long side as the width.
            My obvious intention for this was to maximize the amount space I could use while provinding the user (me) with a large enough handle for use of comfort.
            for the card board demo my main focuse was to framiliarize myself with the components and the overall hardware so I could make further desicions down the line.

            I placed my buttons and swtiches next to the choke of the handle for ease of access for the persons holding thumb or opposing hand in a way would not obstruct its usage.
            The motor was placed under the handle for direct contact with the user in order to get a more responsize sensation that would elicit a deeper sense of immersion.
            The photocell was also placed on the bottom with the intention of leaving more top space for the other components.

          <h5>Artist Statement</h5>
          <p>My approach to my paddle was to try to center as many inputs close to the holding hand in an attempt to make the interface more ergonomic. The point of which was to make the experience of the interface more convenient. I chose to place the momentary button at the top of the handle so the holding thumb could be used to activate it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The program that I modified was the Microsense Pattern program. I swapped out the Michael Jackson track sections with tracks from different songs. These songs are Perfect Cell from Dragon Ball Z and In Da Club by 50 Cent. I also made some adjustments to the ranges on the potentiometer in order to clean up the playability of the tracks.</p>
