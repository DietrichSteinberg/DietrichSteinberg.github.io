              I placed The IMU to the right of the handle, because that was the closest I could place it to the handle with out it being on the handle. 
              I chose to put the light on the top rigth side because I didn't want the neo pixel to produce light that would interfere with the photocell.
              In retrospect that might have made it more interesting.
              <br>
              For the light drawing I picked 2 different enviroments to see what would happen as a result.
              Both were pitch black with no lighting, but one had a large mirror (photo on the right) while the other did not (photo on the left).
