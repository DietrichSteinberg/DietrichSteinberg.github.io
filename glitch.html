        The glitch project, shown below, is a summary of United States involvement in the early 21st century. The project depicts the start and end of US escalation and involvement in Afghanistan and its eventual end.
    The glitches were made using 2 different images with 2 overlapping opacity gradients blurring the two images together. This was done so as to give the allusion that the 2 images are in fact one and therefore inseparable from each other. This was done in order to symbolize the ties that each respective president had.
            The glitch effect was created by copying segments of the image, lowering the opacity of each segment and moving it around, in order to increase the blur effect and to convey the chaotic nature of the situation as a whole. </p1></div>

    <p>The first glitch is meant to depict the initiating event of the invasion of Afghanistan and the public perception of Bush after 911. The picture of the twin towers is the representation of the United States main 
The picture of Bush is meant to symbolize the public support for Bush after 911, and the arrogant mindset of the United States, in their approach to the war in Afghanistan.
The Glitch also addresses the Irony of the increased public support due to 911, because the attack itself occurred due to systemic failures in the intelligence community, which were under his watch.
